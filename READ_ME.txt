HOUDINI VERSION : 18.5.596
My project was to create a procedural asset of Tudor Revival house architecture. 

SimpleTudorHouse.hipnc = The scene with the procedural asset.
			 You can open it to check the process + to play with it.

SimpleTudorHouse_lockVersion.hipnc = Same as SimpleTudorHouse.hipnc but the asset is lock.
				     If SimpleTudorHouse.hipnc don't work, try with it. 

City.hipnc = Example of procedural generation of several asset.


If you can't control the assets, because of non valid Houdini version or something else,
here is a video demonstration of their use : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15Xgedm4djjsgrc0yB6JsMeJ5uBXKYtYC?usp=sharing
